"""Qwen3 (flagship MoE) vs ``transformers.Qwen3MoeForCausalLM``.

The only sparse architecture in the suite, and the only one with QK-norm. Both
are worth pinning down: MoE routing is easy to get subtly wrong, and a routing
difference shows up as a large logit difference rather than a small one.

OLM's router and Qwen3's agree on ordering -- softmax over *all* experts, then
top-k, then renormalise over the selected k -- so no transform is needed on the
gate. Expert weights map one-for-one, with the same gated-MLP half-swap as the
dense Llama family.
